# This is attempt number 9000 to get a file to publish to GitHub.
1.  I have installed Gitbash for window and updated the git.exe t
    I also generated an SSH key with gitbash and pasted it in github.
    I also switched git SSH to "Native"
    Not sure if any of this was necessary because it didn't work on its own.
2. I have created a local repository with GitHub Desktop
3. I have imported that repository into Pycharm
4.  I edited the automatic Reademe.md.
5.  I made a "hello world" python script
6.  I committed to the local repository. Success.
7.  I pushed GitHubDesktop to GitHub success
8. Now I can commit and push directly to Github? wow. awesome.
# success
